## Requirements  

### Forms  
- Create a **registration form** (`index.php`)  
- Create a **login form** (`login.php`)  
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling  
- You can reuse the previous assignmentâ€™s design  

### Validation  
- Ensure **fields are not empty**  
- Password must be **at least 6 characters long**  
- Confirm password must **match the entered password**  

### Backend (`server.php`)  
- Use **MySQLi** or **PDO** to connect to the database  
- Process **all backend logic** in `server.php`  
- **Do not use sessions**  

### JavaScript (Frontend Requests)  
- Use the **Fetch API** to send and receive data in **JSON format**  
- **jQuery is optional**, but Fetch API is required for sending requests  

### Database  
- **Table Name:** `users`  
- **Fields:** `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`

## Process Flow  

### User Registration  
1. Users register via `index.php`  
2. On **successful registration**, redirect to `login.php`  

### User Login  
1. Users log in using their **email** and **password**  
2. If login is successful, redirect to `dashboard.php`  
3. `dashboard.php` should exist but **does not need any design or content**

## Submission Instructions  
1. After completing the assignment, compress **all project files** (including the **database `.sql` file**) into a `.zip` file.  
2. Upload the `.zip` file to the provided link before the deadline.
